## Clinical data 
A simulated dataset was constructed according to ICAN data-collection to approximately remodel main tables and figures.

The dataset is composed of 2505 rows (patients) et 28 variables as the original ICAN data-collection.

The outcome is the rupture. 

To explain IA rupture, there are 27 explanatory variables:
  -	Classical patients’ characteristics: 
    - Age and body mass index (bmi) recorded as quantitative variables
    - Sex, sporadic case recorded as binary variables
  -	Patients’ habits:
    - Tobacco consumption recorded in 3 labels: non-smoker, minor smoker and regular smoker
    - Alcohol consumption recorded as binary variable: <150g and >150g
  -	Intracranial aneurysm’ characteristics:
    - IA location recorded in 4 labels: ICA, MCA, ACA and PCA
    - Adjusted size ratio recorded as quantitative variable
  -	Patients’ medical treatments:
    - Statins, platelet aggregation inhibiting, vitamin K antagonists (vka) or anticoagulant, anti-inflammatories and hormone therapy recorded as binary variables
  -	Patients’ medical history:
    - Ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease (pad), carotid stenosis, aortic aneurysm, hypertension, headaches, diabetes, dyslipidemia, allergies, asthma, atopy and eczema recorded as binary variables
